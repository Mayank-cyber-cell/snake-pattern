# 🐍 Snake Pattern Generator

This project demonstrates how to generate a matrix of integers in a **snake pattern** — a common question in coding interviews and algorithm practice. It’s a simple but effective way to understand 2D array traversal.

## 📌 Features

- Accepts a number of rows and columns
- Generates a 2D matrix filled in a **snake-like** order
- Clean and beginner-friendly Python code

## 📸 Example

For a 3x4 matrix, the output will be:

```
1   2   3   4  
8   7   6   5  
9  10  11  12  
```

## 🔧 How It Works

- Rows are filled left-to-right and right-to-left alternately
- Odd-numbered rows are reversed to form the "snake" pattern
- Matrix is printed row by row after filling

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x

### Run the script

You will be prompted to enter:
- Number of rows
- Number of columns

### Output

It will print a snake-pattern matrix in the console.


## 🤔 Use Cases

- Learning nested loops
- Matrix manipulation practice
- Useful in graphical pathing logic and pattern problems
